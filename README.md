## Side Notes

This a free program, as such, do not expect this to fully 100% do everything you may want it to.
I would recommend you still check yourself for other things I may have missed. \
Set your Download Path to a random folder on your PC that wouldn't be checked e.g. C:\Users\bossl\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft. Your conifg, key and loader will be logged here. \
