# HeadshotHider

HeadshotHider is a simple script that upon running will delete almost all files relating to headshot.su\
It **does not** delete all files as it would take far too long to scan your whole pc for them.\
It **does** delete your config file, registry keys, bin files, recycling bin, any referance to headshot in downloads, recent files folder, prefetch and browser history for all modern browsers (e.g. chrome, opera, firefox, edge, brave etc). \
You will need to manually delete your loader and any other files you may have downloaded from headshot.su not listed above. Sometimes browser history will not delete due to windows therefore check it is deleted.\
Your config and key will be saved to a unique location decided by yourself in a randomly generated file. Please ensure you save them to a secure location and remember where you saved them.

### Download and Install 

On this github repo you will find a file called HeadshotHider.exe download this and save it somewhere.\
You will just need to run it and provide the information it asks for.\
If it does not already run as admin please right click and select run as admin.\

### How to use

Simply run the file and it will do the rest for you.\
Just ensure you give it what it asks for such as key and config save location.\
For these you must give it a filepath such as C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\EdgeCore if you do not know how to do this please google it.\
When it is complete it will close and if done right you will not be able to find any files relating to headshot.su on your pc that is listed.\
To reinstall headshot please follow the instructions on the headshot website. (https://headshot.su/)

This program is **not** made by any headshot.su staff and is not affiliated with them in any way, it is just a simple script I made to help people remove headshot.su from their pc. Please do not open headshot tickets for help.\
The full script is made in golang if anyone wanted to know.
